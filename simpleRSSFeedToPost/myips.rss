<p>The State of Indiana has received approval from the USDA to issue additional P-EBT benefits to eligible students enrolled in Indianapolis Public Schools for the 2020-21 school year. </p>



<p>For information about this program, please reference the FAQs and links below.</p>



<p><strong>How do I apply for my student?</strong></p>



<p>Parents need not apply;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>schools are asked to report all eligible students.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Will I receive a new P-EBT card or do I keep the previous P-EBT card?</strong></p>



<p>Cards are being mailed with the current issuance, and will need to be kept for all future issuances.  The cards from September will NOT be re-loaded and are no good once all benefits are used.</p>



<p><strong>How much will my student receive in benefits?</strong></p>



<p>The benefit amount is determined by the school based upon the number of days the student participated in virtual learning, was in quarantine, or was out of school due to COVID-19 illness. </p>



<p><strong>How were the qualifying students identified?</strong></p>



<p>The parent/student data for those to receive a P-EBT card was provided by the IPS IT department via PowerSchool to FSSA. These funds were mailed to the primary address families had on file in PowerSchool. If your family has not received a P-EBT card and was enrolled in IPS during the designated time frame, then you can update your mailing address with the Indiana Families and Social Services Administration (FSSA) <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=ur-ZIQmkE0-wxBi0WTPYjbJ_x7DdGCFIvwlvRHlpyNNUN1pDMjdWOE1EQ1o5QTJQTkNJTFY0UVlCUi4u" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a>. <em>Note: Only students who were included on the original upload can correct their address. No new names can be submitted using this form. </em></p>



<p>If you would like additional information about this program, please click <a href="https://www.in.gov/fssa/dfr/dfr-policy-changes-and-actions/pandemic-ebt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>Hardon Educational Institute (HEI), in partnership with Indiana’s Office of Work-Based Learning and Apprenticeship (OWBLA), has developed two certified State Earn and Learn (SEAL)&nbsp;programs that were recognized during a virtual announcement Jan. 27. </p>



<p>SEALs are Indiana’s state-level apprenticeship type programs that integrate related classroom instruction, paid on-the-job training and college credits. They are designed to deliver work-and-learn experience for participants, along with the skills and certifications employers value. These programs are geared toward both adult and youth populations and satisfy Indiana’s high school graduation pathway requirements.</p>



<p>For the youth SEAL, HEI worked with Crispus Attucks and Arsenal Technical high schools within Indianapolis Public Schools to expand their health care program offerings. More than 450 students participate in the program. Students enrolled in the health care pathway will be able to earn up to 40 college credits toward an associate degree at Ivy Tech Community College while still in high school.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students can also earn up to seven industry-valued certifications in health care. Students will be working in paid positions with various long-term care and home health care companies. A select cohort of students will also be admitted to the IU Health Fellowship that will take students in the medical assisting program and lead them into career opportunities at IU Health facilities.</p>



<p>“We are grateful to HEI, the OWBLA and Ivy Tech for their partnership and this amazing opportunity for our students,” said Aleesia Johnson, IPS superintendent. “Thanks to this SEAL certification in health sciences, students will have multiple options available to them in the health care industry, graduating even more prepared to meet workforce demands with a strong head start on earning a postsecondary degree.”</p>



<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need to invest in the next generation of health care providers, and we know there are capable, passionate students in our own backyard,” said Dennis Murphy, president and CEO of IU Health. “Our partnership with IPS can help drive the success of its students. By removing barriers of access and finance, this program will promote student success and satisfaction, leading to a stable workforce and improving the economic landscape of Indiana.”</p>



<p>HEI also continues their success as an adult training provider and is expanding their programming with a certified SEAL that integrates six industry certifications. Adults can earn stackable credentials while they work, earning their medical assisting certification with externship hours at Eskenazi Health and other ambulatory care settings. Partnerships include Aperion Care Waldron, American Senior Communities, Trilogy Health Services and United Home Healthcare.</p>



<p>Brandi London, chief education officer at HEI said, &#8220;Our youth and adult programs are designed to help students stack credentials and to develop an informed and competent workforce in health care. We&#8217;re excited to do our part in meeting these demands.”</p>



<p>&#8220;It has truly&nbsp;been a great&nbsp;experience working with the students of HEI, partnering within our own community to help cultivate tomorrow&#8217;s future health care leaders,” said Edna Davenport, administrator in training for American Senior Communities at Bethany Village.</p>



<p>“The SEAL programs are a model for what health care partnerships can look like to build a comprehensive work-based learning program,”&nbsp;said Mee Hee Smith, OWBLA Regional Director. “The programs encompass home health care, long-term care and acute care systems, all collaborating to build health care talent pipelines. We look forward to sharing this best-practice model with both employers and training providers across Indiana to meet the demands of a 21st century skilled workforce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Indiana Department of Workforce Development projects Indiana employers will need to fill more than one million additional jobs in the next 10 years, half of which will not require a four-year college degree, but certification or credentials beyond a high school diploma.</p>



<p>For more information about the Hardon Educational Institute SEAL or SEALs in general, visit the OWBLA website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.inwbl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.INwbl.com</a>&nbsp;or email the Office of Work-Based Learning and Apprenticeship at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:wbl@dwd.in.gov">wbl@dwd.in.gov</a>&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Converse, Inc., the global footwear and apparel brand recognized around the world for its iconic All Star sneakers recently announced it will be releasing a Breaking Down Barriers collection, which pays homage to and is inspired by the 1954-1955 Crispus Attucks High School basketball team. Led by a young Oscar Robertson, the team won Indiana’s State basketball championship – marking it as the first time an all-Black team won the state title.</p>



<p>Their story is all the more remarkable as the young men faced profound prejudice at home and across the state. In fact, the reason for the team’s existence was due primarily to segregation; it wasn’t until 1942 that they were granted membership to compete in the tournament.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In honor of the trailblazing 1955 Crispus Attucks High School team, Converse features the champions’ team colors, as well as materials representative of their varsity letterman’s jacket on the original basketball sneaker, the Chuck 70 and the classic Converse Pro Leather.</p>

This includes decisions impacting classrooms, grade levels or the entire building. This will be a collaborative process between school and district leadership.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left"><em>&#8220;This morning, we learned that Ann Wilkins, a former longtime IPS teacher, who also served as our ISTA representative, passed away. Ann was a longstanding, passionate advocate for public education and, more specifically, for the teachers and students of Indianapolis Public Schools,&#8221; said Johnson. &#8220;I count myself fortunate to have known her and will miss the personal relationship we were able to build.&nbsp;She will be terribly missed by so many in our district. On behalf of our district leadership team and the Board of School Commissioners, we send our most sincere condolences to her family. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers during this devastating time.&#8221;</em></p>
